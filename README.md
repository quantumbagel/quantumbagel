# 👋 I'm Julian Reder!

### Bio

I'm a Wake Tech student currently working on various random projects and taking an internship with NC State's AERPAW drone lab.
I've been coding since I was 8 - and I still learn something new every time!

I've started catalouging my most interesting projects here on GitHub. These will probably (mostly) consist of the following:

* Discord bots that I screw around with
* My NC State AERPAW projects
* Other random (probably Python) projects that I take on

  
- 🔭 I’m currently working on:
  - Advent of Code 2023 ⭐
  - airstrik.py and CameraDistance - two projects under my NC State internship
- 🌱 I’m currently learning
  - How to develop games with Unity and Unreal Engine
  - How to optimize Java programs
- 💻 My languages
   - Python - 🟢 Extremely proficient
   - Javascript/Node.js - 🟡 Proficient, just haven't worked on it in a little while
   - C# - 🟡 Proficient, need to work on optimization
   - Docker/Docker Compose - 🟡 Proficient
   - Java - 🟡 Mostly proficient - not very efficient at programming in it - could use a refresh
   - HTML/CSS 🔴 Not great - know enough to get around, but haven't really worked in it at all

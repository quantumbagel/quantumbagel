# ðŸ‘‹ I'm Julian Reder!

### Bio

I'm a Wake Tech student currently working on various random projects and taking an internship with NC State's AERPAW drone lab.
I've been coding since I was 8 - and I still learn something new every time!

I've started catalouging my most interesting projects here on GitHub - so they will probably be mostly Python - with maybe some C# and Docker Compose to boot.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
  - Hannibal - A https://generals.io bot
  - Statify - Minecraft stats done better
  - airstrik.py and CameraDistance - two projects under my NC State internship
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning
  - How to use selenium efficiently in programs
  - How to develop games with Unity and Unreal Engine
- ðŸ’» My languages
   - Python - ðŸŸ¢ Extremely proficient
   - Javascript/Node.js - ðŸŸ¡ Mostly proficient, just haven't worked on it in a little while
   - C# - ðŸŸ¡ Mostly proficient, need to work on optimization / malloc
   - Docker/Docker Compose - ðŸŸ¡ Mostly proficient
   - Java - ðŸŸ¡ Mostly proficient - not very efficient at programming in it - could use a refresh

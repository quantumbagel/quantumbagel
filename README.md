### Bio

I'm a Wake Tech student currently working on various random projects and taking an internship with NC State's AERPAW drone lab.
I've been coding since I was 8 - and I still learn something new every time!

I've started catalouging my most interesting projects here on GitHub - so they will probably be mostly Python - with maybe some C# and Docker Compose to boot.

  - Hannibal - A https://generals.io bot
  - Molotov - A https://jklm.fun bot
  - Sebastian Lague's Chess Challenge
  - BlokusCloud - my own attempt to make an online multiplayer game that works (this is struggling under Google Firebase's rate limits)
  - airstrik.py and CameraDistance - two projects under my NC State internship

### Bio

I'm a North Carolina State University student, a cross country runner, serial programmer, professional bagel, and general idiot who uses GitHub for my various crazy projects.


### Accomplishments
* Member of the Julian C. Stanley Study of Exceptional Talent (funny coincidence lol)
* WTCC - Associate's in Engineering
* Accepted to NCSU's College of Engineering for a `Computer Engineering` major
* Park Scholarship Class of 2029 semifinalist
* Top 5% AMC 8 / Top 10% AMC12B (in 8th grade), Top 0.1% in CLT, SSAT, SAT
* Winner of the Clarence M. Smith, Jr. Scholarship for the 2025-26 school year.
* Graduated college at 16

I'm working towards getting my Masters in `Computer Science` by the summer of 2028.


### Actual programming stuff

Most of the projects I work on here fall into three categories:

* Discord bots that I screw around with (`Triggered`, `Piranha`, `PlayCord`) 
* My NC State AERPAW projects (`airstrik.py`, `DroneTracker`, etc.)
* Other random projects that I take on for fun (`Molotov`, `finiteCraft`)

## 👋 I'm Julian Reder!

### Bio

I'm a Wake Tech student, cross country running, serial programmer, professional bagel, and general idiot who uses GitHub for my various crazy projects.

I've been taking an internship with NC State's AERPAW drone lab since 8th grade, a member of the Julian C. Stanley Study of Exceptional Talent (funny coincidence, have been accepted to NCSU's College of Engineering for a `Computer Engineering` major, and am a Park Scholarship semifinalist. I'm working towards getting my Masters in `Computer Science` by the summer of 2028.


### Actual programming stuff

Most of the projects I work on here fall into three categories:

* Discord bots that I screw around with (`Triggered`, `Piranha`, `PlayCord`) 
* My NC State AERPAW projects (`airstrik.py`, `DroneTracker`, etc.)
* Other random projects that I take on for fun (`Molotov`, `finiteCraft`)

  
- ### 🔭 I’m currently working on:
  - `PyAerial` - NC STATE intership project, successor to `airstrik.py`
  - `PlayCord` - a discord minigame bot
- ### 😠 Projects I'm procrastinating on:
  - `Triggered` - an IFTTT discord bot that really only needs hardening
  - `finiteCraft` - i hate cloudflare js captchas
  - `Statify/Gauss Engine` - I want to work on this but can't find the time
- ###  🌱 I’m currently learning
  - How to handle distractions and deal with 16-20 credits per semester
  - How to plan out projects
- ### 💻🗣️ My languages
   - `Python` - 🟢 Extremely proficient
   - `Selenium / Web Scraping` - 🟢 Extremely good
   - `Beating @Pixelz22` - 🟢 My most consistent skill
   - `Docker/Docker Compose` - 🟢 Extremely good
   - `Javascript/Node.js` - 🟡 Proficient, just haven't worked on it in a little while
   - `C#` - 🟡 Proficient
   - `Java` - 🟡 Proficient
   - `HTML/CSS` 🔴 Not great - know enough to get around, but haven't really worked in it at all
 - ### ⌚ Future projects
   - `Lights Out!` - a puzzle platformer game I might make with `@Pixelz22`
   - `CustomCrafter` - a SpigotMC crafting plugin for Minecraft
   - `WeBlock / Disney Square` - a lockdown / time management program for Windows, Linux, and MacOS. Might work on this with `@Pixelz22`.

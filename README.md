### Projects

Most of the projects I work on here fall into three categories:

* Discord bots that I screw around with (`Triggered`, `Piranha`, `PlayCord`) 
* My NC State AERPAW projects (`airstrik.py`, `DroneTracker`, `aerpawlib`, etc.)
* Other random projects that I take on for fun (`Molotov`, `finiteCraft`)

Everything public is either being worked on or is in a "finished" state.

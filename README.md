# ðŸ‘‹ I'm Julian Reder!

### Bio

I'm a Wake Tech student currently working on various random projects and taking an internship with NC State's AERPAW drone lab.
I've been coding since I was 8 - and I still learn something new every time!

I've started catalouging my most interesting projects here on GitHub. These will probably (mostly) consist of the following:

* Discord bots that I screw around with
* My NC State AERPAW projects
* Other random (probably Python) projects that I take on

  
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
  - PyAerial - NC STATE intership project
  - Triggered - a discord bot
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning
  - How to develop games with Unity and Unreal Engine
  - How to optimize Java programs
  - ADS-B packet structure
- ðŸ’» My languages
   - Python - ðŸŸ¢ Extremely proficient
   - Javascript/Node.js - ðŸŸ¡ Proficient, just haven't worked on it in a little while
   - C# - ðŸŸ¡ Proficient, need to work on optimization
   - Docker/Docker Compose - ðŸŸ¡ Proficient

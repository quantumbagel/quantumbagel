### Bio

I'm a Wake Tech student, a cross country runner, serial programmer, professional bagel, and general idiot who uses GitHub for my various crazy projects.


### Accomplishments
* Member of the Julian C. Stanley Study of Exceptional Talent (funny coincidence lol)
* Accepted to NCSU's College of Engineering for a `Computer Engineering` major
* Park Scholarship Class of 2029 semifinalist
* Top 5% AMC 8 / Top 10% AMC12B (in 8th grade), Top 0.1% in CLT, SSAT, SAT
* Winner of the Clarence M. Smith, Jr. Scholarship for the 2025-26 school year.

I'm working towards getting my Masters in `Computer Science` by the summer of 2028.


### Actual programming stuff

Most of the projects I work on here fall into three categories:

* Discord bots that I screw around with (`Triggered`, `Piranha`, `PlayCord`) 
* My NC State AERPAW projects (`airstrik.py`, `DroneTracker`, etc.)
* Other random projects that I take on for fun (`Molotov`, `finiteCraft`)

  
- ### 🔭 I’m currently working on:
  - `PyAerial` - NC STATE intership project, successor to `airstrik.py`
  - `PlayCord` - a discord minigame bot
- ### 😠 Projects I'm procrastinating on:
  - `Triggered` - an IFTTT discord bot that really only needs hardening
  - `finiteCraft` - i hate cloudflare js captchas
  - `Statify/Gauss Engine` - I want to work on this but can't find the time
- ###  🌱 I’m currently learning
  - How to handle distractions and deal with 16-20 credits per semester
  - How to plan out projects
- ### 💻🗣️ My languages
   - `Python` - 🟢 Extremely proficient
   - `Selenium / Web Scraping` - 🟢 Extremely good
   - `Beating @Pixelz22` - 🟢 My most consistent skill
   - `Docker/Docker Compose` - 🟢 Extremely good
   - `Javascript/Node.js` - 🟡 Proficient, just haven't worked on it in a little while
   - `C#` - 🟡 Proficient
   - `Java` - 🟡 Proficient
   - `HTML/CSS` 🔴 Not great - know enough to get around, but haven't really worked in it at all
 - ### ⌚ Future projects
   - `Lights Out!` - a puzzle platformer game I might make with `@Pixelz22`
   - `CustomCrafter` - a SpigotMC crafting plugin for Minecraft
   - `WeBlock / Disney Square` - a lockdown / time management program for Windows, Linux, and MacOS. Might work on this with `@Pixelz22`.

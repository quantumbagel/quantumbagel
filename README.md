## ðŸ‘‹ I'm Julian Reder!


I'm a Wake Tech student currently working on various random projects and taking an internship with NC State's AERPAW drone lab. 

I'm looking at either a `Computer Science` or `Computer Engineering` degree at NC State after dually enrolling at Wake Tech.


Most of the projects I work on here fall into three categories:

* Discord bots that I screw around with (`Triggered`, `Piranha`) 
* My NC State AERPAW projects (`airstrik.py`, `CameraDistance`, etc.)
* Other random projects that I take on for fun (`Molotov`, `InfiniteScrape`)


  
- ### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
  - `PyAerial` - NC STATE intership project (currently private)
  - `Triggered` - a discord bot (almost completed!)
  - `InfiniteScrape` - a bot to scrape Neal Agarwal's Infinite Craft (with `@Pixelz22`)
  - `quantumbagel.github.io` - my new website based off of vCard.
- ###  ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning
  - How to manage extensive college workloads :(
  - ADS-B packet structure
  - How to mod games
- ### ðŸ’» My languages
   - `Python` - ðŸŸ¢ Extremely proficient
   - `Selenium / Web Scraping` - ðŸŸ¢ Extremely good
   - `Beating Tyler` - ðŸŸ¢ Extremely good at reliably doing.
   - `Javascript/Node.js` - ðŸŸ¡ Proficient, just haven't worked on it in a little while
   - `C#` - ðŸŸ¡ Proficient, need to work on optimization
   - `Docker/Docker Compose` - ðŸŸ¡ Proficient
   - `Java` - ðŸŸ¡ Proficient
   - `HTML/CSS` ðŸ”´ Not great - know enough to get around, but haven't really worked in it at all
 - ### âŒš Future projects
   - `Lights Out!` - a puzzle platformer game I might make with `@Pixelz22`
   - `CustomCrafter` - a SpigotMC crafting plugin for Minecraft
   - `WeBlock / Disney Square` - a lockdown / time management program for Windows, Linux, and MacOS. Might work on this with `@Pixelz22`.
